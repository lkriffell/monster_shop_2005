## Introduction

__Monster Shop__ was the group project assigned to the 2006 Back End cohort during Module 2 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). Students were tasked with creating a [fictitious e-commerce platform](https://polar-wildwood-61165.herokuapp.com/) that allowed for _regular users_, _merchants/merchant employees_, and an _admin_ account that served as a "super user."

A [starter repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/monster_shop_2005) was provided which included some premade files. Students worked together in paired and individual sessions to build a web application utilizing a [model-view-controller](https://backend.turing.io/module2/lessons/intro_to_mvc) design pattern and [CRUD functionality](https://backend.turing.io/module2/lessons/restful_routes_and_crud), where _regular users_ would be able to register and create a profile, add items to a shopping cart, and check out. _Merchant employees_ had capabilitites such as marking items as fulfilled, and those items would eventually be shipped by an _admin_.

Students worked remotely over a 9-day period using Slack, Zoom, Github, and [Github projects](https://github.com/Arique1104/monster_shop_2005/projects/1) to attempt 54 user stories. Test-driven development drove the creation of ReSTful routes with tests written in RSpec.

Our app is deployed to Heroku [here.](https://monster-shop-group-project.herokuapp.com/)

## Schema

## Refactoring

Our group refactored numerous parts of the project while we worked. A particularly successful simplification reconstructed the Navigation Bar from over 30 lines to 4 lines using [partials](https://backend.turing.io/module2/lessons/partials) and `ApplicationController` methods.

## Testing

We used SimpleCov to track the test coverage and keep us on track with TDD.

### Extra Fun

We used an [RSpec formatter](https://github.com/mattsears/nyan-cat-formatter) to display a colorful [Nyan Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat) when running tests.
